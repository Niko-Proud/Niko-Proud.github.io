            The Difference Engine was designed by CHarles Babbage in the 1820's, and was a mechanical calculator. It was designed to automatically use tables to work through polynomial functions.
            the machine was not completed in Babbage's lifetime due to funding issues and the limitations of his eras metalworking technology. Despite this, two functioning engines exist, with the first being built in the 1980's, and the second in the 1990's, Proving that Babbage's design was sound.
