            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852) is referred to by some as the first compuer programmer due to her work with Charles Babbage and his engines. As a child of nobility, she was an educated Mathematician and writer.
            Unlike Babbage, She believed that computers could be used for more than calculations. over the years working with Babbage, she translated notes from a student attending a seminar by Babbage into english.
            She not only translated the notes, but also expanded upon them, adding such things as an explanation of the differences between the difference engine and the analytical engine.
            Her notes also include what is credited by some as the first published computer program, which was a desription for a methd to have the theoretical device calculate Bernoulli numbers.
