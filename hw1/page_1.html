            Charles Babbage (1797-1871), was a multifaceted man who partook in many fields. His areas of study included Mathematics, Engineering, Phylosophy, and, most importantly for us, Invention.
            He would be considered by some to be the father of the field of computing, due to his invention of the difference engine, and later design of the analytical engine. Both were mechanical devices intended to do complex mathematical calculations.
            He unfortunately died before many of his designs were built or able to be tested, including the analytical engine and difference egine. The Science Museum in London has pieces from several of his designs, as well as some of his designs themselves, on display.
            There has also been attempts to construct the analytical engine, though no source claims that a device has been completely constructed as of yet.
